# MHIST Pipeline Demo App

This project focuses on developing fundamental MLOps skills rather than doing
a major modeling task. The plan:
[] Train a Lightning model on the MHIST binary classification task, using GCP.
[] Track experiments with Weights and Biases.
[] Serve model via FastAPI running on GCP.
[] Simple web app allows user to upload an MHIST image for classificaiton, and
to give feedback.
